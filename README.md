# Objective
This project is test out and record a process where I can mimic a team working on a single project. 


## Resource

[Bitbucket GIT Tutorial](200~https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository)

## Common Situation 

- [ ] Linear commits (a few commits with images to pretend to be working on an already started project)
- [ ] Download FORK to view repo's history or use git log
- [ ] Add change to previous commit (git commit --amend)
- [ ] git clone (show how to download repo)
- [ ] Show what checkout does 
- [ ] Make a lot of files and changes to many files. Found out you don't want to changes. do git checkout HEAD
- [ ] Someone make a change and git push and then pull (show how to get the latest version)
- [ ] Look into a file and make some test changes. Save the file. Decide you don't want it. git checkout filename
- [ ] Make changes, commit, decided you want to remove that commit (git reset --soft HEAD)
- [ ] Create master, dev branch (describe their purpose, rebase for dev, merge with master)
- [ ] Multiple people create feature branch based on the dev branch
- [ ] Everybody submit their imcomplete branch to remote
- [ ] git pull to get everyone's remote branch and see them
- [ ] Make every commit 5 commits. Then rebase it because it is too messy
- [ ] One person do a PR and merge (make them constantly do git fetch and pull to get the latest show that it doesn't hurt and that you always is with the latest)
- [ ] Everyone update their repo and rebase to the latest dev
- [ ] Everyone submit their PR. Merge. (Show that your branch doesn't need to always be latest to merge)
- [ ] Merge dev to master to 'release' the project. (never directly rebase to master)[golden rule of rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing#the-golden-rule-of-rebasing) "is anyone else looking at this branch? if yes, take yo
- [ ] Do merge vs rebase
- [ ] After opening a PR, the boss as you to rebase to the latest which requires git push --force-with-lease
- [ ] A merge conflict from rebasing with master which has a few features added. 
- [ ] A separate example that will be deleted later to show using merge vs rebase when trying to get the latest from master. 
- [ ] get a rebase error to see what happens.
